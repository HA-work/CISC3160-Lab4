This folder has 4 files.

The first is a refrence guide that has some important concepts of the Ruby language. It also has links to websites with more information to learn Ruby.

The second file is the pseudocode for the functions that I made. It explains the logic behind the workings of each of the functions.

The third file is the source code which is the actual working code of the functions that I made.

The last file is some reflections that I have on Ruby.
